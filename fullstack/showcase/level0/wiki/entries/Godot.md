#Godot

Godot is a 2D and 3D, **cross-platform**, **free** and **open-source** game engine released under the MIT license. It was initially developed for several companies in Latin America prior to its public release. The development environment runs on multiple operating systems including **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows**. **Godot** can create games targeting PC, mobile, and web platforms.
It's my favorite **game engine**!
